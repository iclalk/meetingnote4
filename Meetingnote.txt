Friday 3.30


We are almost done with our project. We Made sure to keep it simple and not too complicated for people who are going to visit our website. First of all, we worked hard to make it easy for everyone to use, we applied a great cover image and a little bit about the story of our website and also the story of the brands that we are going to present to our the audience. We did not target a specific audience, so everyone can feel free to visit and check our website with no difficulties. Me and my team member selected a very good design because we strongly believe that is going to make a difference and everyone will like it, find it interesting. The pictures that we provided do not belong to us most of them we find it thru internet. Also we choose to provide famous people this way we thought this can be effective and helpful for our audience. This week we are meeting to make our last touch, prepare our presentation video and last but not least we are happy with the work we did.
We choose to work on this topic because we all know that online shopping its now a big thing.
